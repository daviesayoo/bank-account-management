Welcome to my Website

# Bank Manage Website

This is the only front-end bank account management platform I have developed in Vanilla JS.

On the platform, enter the balance you wish to deposit or withdraw in the input field.

When you click the Confirm button, the user's transaction balance and remaining balance will be displayed.

Select a user and balance and click the Confirm button to display the current user's balance.


# Class Define

The account and transaction method of the user using the bank have been defined into class called "BankAccount"

# Switch statement

User selection and transaction methods are handled with switch statements.

# Try Catch statement
All exceptions that occur during balance calculation is handled with this command.
